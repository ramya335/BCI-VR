# "Thinking" About the Next Generation of Gaming

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to find a way to increase user imersion in a virtual reality game. The way our group is attempting to reach this goal is by using a BCI device to use brain signals to control the game. We believe that by allowing a user to play a game with just his mind and without a controller, then the user will be more entertained. We have three different types of ways to play the game to compare the data to see which way produces the most imersion.
